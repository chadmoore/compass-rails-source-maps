# Compass Rails Source Maps

A small monkeypatch to enable sourcemaps with compass-rails

Heavily based on https://github.com/vhyza/sass-rails-source-maps

That gem doesn't work as-is with compass as compass-rails patches default sass\sprockets code

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
    group :development do
      gem 'compass-rails-source-maps'
    end

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install compass-rails-source-maps

## Usage

See https://github.com/vhyza/sass-rails-source-maps
